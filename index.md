## Welcome to my UGANutrition Website

Below I will be showcasing some features that my application will offer and it's capabilities. This application will only be available for download onto computers, but will be made available for web browsers and mobile phones in the future. I am open to any suggestions just email me at yaudev2601@gmail.com. Thank You!

### Account Management

With UGANutrition you will be able to create your own account to manage and track your journey. If that's not your cup of tea you can also continue to use the app as a guest.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bny11638/UGANutrition/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
