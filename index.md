Below I will be showcasing some features that my application will offer and it's capabilities.

### The Home Page
UGANutrition's home page features a variety of graphs that helps visualize a user's goals and current nutrition standings. These graphs include a Calorie Bar to show how many calories have been consumed and a line to denote the calorie goal, A macronutrient vertical bar graph to visualize the distribution of macronutrients of that day's diet.
At the top it also includes user information as well as those graphs but quantified into a list. Of course for each different food added the graph's will update automatically and reflect the changes.

### Customizing Your Plate
Much like the home page when a user want's to add their food they are met with a visually stunning UI with an explosion of information about the food they want to add. At the top there will be numerical values describing the contents of the food and at the bottom there are 3 graphs, 2 of which are very similar to those of the home page except for the fact that when a user selects a food there will be highlighted portions of the graphs to emphasize what they are adding onto there diet. Then there is a pie graph which visualizes the distribution of macronutrients for the food.
